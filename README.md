# Quantum Suicide

When I lived in Vancouver in the late 2000s, my good friend Gerrit was an aspiring filmmaker
and decided to write and direct his first movie about the thought experiment commonly known as
Quantum Suicide. It's basically Schrodingers Cat if you're the cat.

The central part of the film involves a physicist that builds a particle accelerator in his garage.
A lot of the inspiration for the design of the set came from what I saw when I visited the TRIUMF UBC particle
accelerator. My other good friend Raf was responsible for a lot of the construction.

To show the main characters interactions with the accelerator, we needed some kind of funky looking computer
interface, and because we didn't have an animator to create mockups, I just wrote a program in Python/Pygame
that interactively showed a bunch of nonsense graphs and had a fake terminal that spit out fake sciency data
using quantum mechanics words I found on wikipedia. It was basically a ripoff of the computer terminal in the
movie Pi (one of my favourite films).
